    "(5 points; .5 pt per attribute and method)\n",

    "Create a BookLover class in a file named `booklover.py`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Attributes\n",
    "\n",
    "|Attribute | Value |\n",
    "|----------|-------|\n",
    "| `name` | The name of the person (type:string) |\n",
    "| `email` | The person’s email, serving as a unique identifier (type:string) |\n",
    "| `fav_genre` | The person’s favorite book genre (e.g., mystery, fantasy, or historical fiction).  (type:string) |\n",
    "| `num_books` | Keeps track of the number of books the person has read (type:int) |\n",
    "| `book_list` | a dataframe with the columns `['book_name', 'book_rating']`\n",
    "\n",
    "The columns in `book_list` have the following meanings:\n",
    "- `book_name` is the title of the book the person has read.\n",
    "- `book_rating` is the person’s rating of that book on a scale of 1 to 5, where 1 means the person did not like the book at all, and 5 means the person loved the book. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some example book entries are:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "(\"Jane Eyre\", 4)\n",
    "(\"Fight Club\", 3)\n",
    "(\"The Divine Comedy\", 5)\n",
    "(\"The Popol Vuh\", 5)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "**Initializer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "`__init__()`:\n",
    "- `name`, `email`, and `fav_genre` (in this order) are required. \n",
    "- `num_books` and `book_list` are optional.\n",
    "- Use these default parameters: \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "  num_books = 0\n",
    "  book_list = pd.DataFrame({'book_name':[], 'book_rating':[]})\n",
    "```\n",
    "Do not add any additional fields of your own.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Method 1:**\n",
    "\n",
    "`add_book(book_name, rating)`:\n",
    "- This function takes a `book name` (string) and `rating` (integer from 0 to 5)\n",
    "- It tries to add the book to `book_list`. See hint below on how to pass a new book to the dataframe.\n",
    "- Only add a book to the person’s `book_list` if that book doesn’t already exist.\n",
    "  - It is sufficient to match on `book_name`.\n",
    "- If it does exist, tell the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hint: To add a new book to the book list (which is a dataframe), do this in your method, where `book_name` and `book_rating` are the arguments passed to the method.:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "new_book = pd.DataFrame({\n",
    "    'book_name': [book_name], \n",
    "    'book_rating': [book_rating]\n",
    "})\n",
    "\n",
    "self.book_list = pd.concat([self.book_list, new_book], ignore_index=True)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, be sure to see if `book_name` is not in the book list.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Method 2:**\n",
    "\n",
    "`has_read(book_name)`\n",
    "- This function takes `book_name` (string) as input and determines if the person has read the book.\n",
    "  - That is, if that `book name` is in `book_list`. \n",
    "  - Again, it is sufficient to match on `book_name`.\n",
    "- The method should return `True` if the person has read the book, `False` otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Method 3:**\n",
    "\n",
    "`num_books_read()`\n",
    "- This function takes no parameters and just returns the total number of books the person has read.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Method 4:**\n",
    "\n",
    "`fav_books()`:\n",
    "- This function takes no parameters and returns the filtered dataframe of the person’s most favorite books. \n",
    "- Books in this list should have a rating > 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Once you have created your class**\n",
    "\n",
    "Be sure to instantiate your class to see if everything is working. You can do this by prototyping your class in a notebook, where you can run code that uses it there, and then save the class to the `.py` file when you are done. \n",
    "\n",
    "Or you can create a another file, say `demo.py` that imports and uses the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "A final option -- which the test file will use -- is to put this code at the bottom of your `.py` file, after and outside of your class definition:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\n",
    "if __name__ == '__main__':\n",
    "    \n",
    "    test_object = BookLover(\"Han Solo\", \"hsolo@millenniumfalcon.com\", \"scifi\")\n",
    "    test_object.add_book(\"War of the Worlds\", 4)\n",
    "    # And so forth\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "NOTE: The methods listed above do not have `self` as their first argument, but they should in your class."
